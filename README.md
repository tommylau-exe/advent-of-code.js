# advent-of-code.js

This project is structured as a set of standalone Node/Deno scripts. All scripts assume that the
puzzle input is provided via stdin.

## Example usage

```sh
./src/2023/1.js < ./example/2023/1.1.txt
```

This computes the solution to the Advent of Code problem given in 2023 on day 1 using the first
example text as input.

## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to Eric Wastl and everyone that contributed to Advent of Code. In accordance with the
guidance on [Advent of Code's "About" page][1], I don't check in puzzle text or inputs in this repo.
